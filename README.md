# Binomial-Option-Pricing-Model



The Binomial Option Pricing Model is a mathematical approach for valuing options by simulating the possible price movements of the underlying asset over discrete time intervals. It considers two possible outcomes at each stepâ€”upward and downward movements. By constructing a binomial tree, the model calculates the option's expected value at each node, incorporating factors like volatility and risk-free rate. This iterative process allows for the determination of option prices at various points in time, facilitating more informed and precise pricing decisions in dynamic and uncertain financial markets. The Binomial Model is versatile, applicable to both European and American-style options, providing a robust framework for option valuation and risk management.
